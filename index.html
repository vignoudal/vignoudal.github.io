        About me 
      </h1>
      <p>After two years of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles">
          classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles</a> (CPGE), I entered the engineering school
        <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/">CentraleSupélec</a> where I'm currently studying
        as a first year student.</p>

          <h2 class="hobby">Volleyball</h2>
          <p>I started playing beach volleyball with friends during my final years of high school.
          As my passion for the sport grew, we began playing several times a week. During my years
          in classe préparatoire, I could only play occasionally. However, since joining my
          engineering school, I’ve become a member of the volleyball club and have been having
          a great time.

          <h2 class="hobby">Running</h2>
          I started running at a young age with school races, and kept it up afterwards,
          though not regularly. Since my dad took part in many marathons and half-marathons,
          I got to see races in different countries.

          <h2 class="hobby">Saxophone</h2>
          I played the saxophone for 9 years, from 5 to 14 years old. I didn't play at all
          until the end of my CPGE, but since I started at CentraleSupélec, I've had the chance
          to play again a few times

          <h2 class="hobby">Inside climbing</h2>
          I started indoor climbing (bouldering) during my first year of CPGE,
          as my mom, sister, and brother were practicing regularly (and still do).
          I really enjoyed it and still climb occasionally with them.
